 <br>AGAR or AGAR-AGAR (see also KANTEN)
[AH-gahr or AG-er AG-er]
Flavor: virtually none
Volume: extremely quiet
What it is: a thickening agent made from seaweed; a vegetarian
substitute for gelatin
Nutritional profile: 94% carbs / 5% protein / 1% fat
Calories: 0 per 1-tablespoon serving
 Tips: To gel, use about 2–3 teaspoons of agar powder (or 2–3
 tablespoons of agar flakes) per 1 cup of boiling liquid. Unlike
 regular gelatin (which requires refrigeration), agar can gel at
 room temperature in about an hour (although it will gel twice as
 fast in the refrigerator). Substitute agar powder for the same
 amount of gelatin in recipes. Avoid raw mangoes, papayas,
 pineapple (whose enzymes won’t let agar set); cook these fruits
 first if you’d like to gel them.
Possible substitute: gelatin

AGAVE NECTAR
[ah-GAH-vay NECK-ter]
Flavor: sweet, with notes of caramel, fruit, honey, and/or maple
syrup
Volume: quiet (light)–moderate (amber or dark)
What it is: sweetener similar in color and texture to honey, made
from the agave plant, a Mexican succulent
Nutritional profile: 100% carbs
Calories: 20 per teaspoon
 Tips: Agave is sweeter than sugar, so you can use less. Because
 baked goods made with agave may brown more quickly, lower
 oven temperature by 25°F and slightly extend baking time.

 <br>“It’s easier to make caramel sauce from agave nectar than it
 <br>is to make it from sugar—because it’s already a liquid! Heat
 <br>it on low, slow heat until it caramelizes, then stir in a little
 <br>Earth Balance and almond or soy milk.”

ARROWROOT (aka ARROWROOT FLOUR,
POWDER, or STARCH)
Flavor: virtually none
Volume: very quiet
What it is: a thickening agent, less processed than cornstarch,
made from the arrowroot plant (a tuber grown in the tropics)
Gluten-free: yes
Tips: Dissolve in a little cold water before adding to sauces; or
dissolve about one tablespoon of powder per cup of cold liquid
before bringing it to a simmer. It becomes clear as it cooks. Stir
constantly, and do not overheat, which makes arrowroot lose its
thickening power.

 <br>AVOCADO
Season: spring–summer
Flavor: buttery in flavor and texture, with fruity and nutty notes
Volume: quiet
What it is: technically a fruit
Nutritional profile: 77% fat / 19% carbs / 4% protein
Calories: 325 per avocado (raw)
Protein: 4 grams
Techniques: Always serve raw, as cooking makes avocados
taste bitter. Mash into guacamole, hummus, or sandwich spreads,
or slice for salads.
Tips: Haas avocados are the smaller, dark green, firm variety
(more flavorful, and better for guacamole), while Florida
avocados are larger and brighter green (and they can sometimes
be watery). Use avocados to add richness to a dish, whether a dip
or spread or even a dessert.

 <br>“Avocados are key vegetables for raw foodists. They’re
 <br>meaty and creamy at the same time, and versatile enough to
 <br>be used in salad dressings, soups, and wraps.”
 <br>—AMI BEACH, G-ZEN (BRANFORD, CT)



 <br>“I love avocados and eat one every day. In one of my
 <br>favorite salads, the richness of avocado is balanced by the
 <br>acidity of tomato and the sweetness of watermelon. And
 <br>avocados are versatile; as a pastry chef, I even use them in
 <br>my chocolate mousse.”
 <br>—FERNANDA CAPOBIANCO, VEGAN DIVAS (NEW YORK CITY)



 <br>“Mashed avocado on bread is like the PB&J of Jamaica.
 <br>After my friends and I played soccer, we’d raid the cupboard
 <br>for bread and climb the tree in my backyard for ‘pears,’ as
 <br>we call them there, to eat on the bread, maybe with just a
 <br>little salt. Their flavor is so fresh and bright.”

 <br>BANANAS
Flavor: sweet, with astringent notes, and a firm, creamy texture
Volume: quiet
What it is: fruit
Nutritional profile: 93% carbs / 4% protein / 3% fat
Calories: 105 per medium banana (raw)
Protein: 1 gram
Techniques: bake, broil, caramelize, deep-fry, freeze (e.g., for
smoothies), grill, poach, puree, raw, sauté
 Tips: Freeze before adding to smoothies to eliminate or reduce
 the need for ice. Puree frozen bananas—or put through a
 Champion juicer (using the “Blank” instead of the “Screen”),
 and they will come out the texture of soft-serve ice cream to
 enjoy as-is or with toppings such as maple syrup and nuts.

 <br>BARLEY (e.g., HULLED)
Flavor: sweet, with astringent notes of nuts, and chewy in texture
Volume: quiet–moderate
What it is: whole grain
Nutritional profile: 82% carbs / 13% protein / 5% fat
Gluten-free: no
Calories: 100 per 1-ounce serving (yields about ½ cup)
Protein: 3 grams
Techniques: boil, pressure-cook, simmer, steam, toast
Timing: Soak overnight before cooking. Cook presoaked whole
barley about 35–40 minutes or longer, covered. If not presoaked,
cook about 75 minutes, until tender. (Note: Quick-cooking barley
takes only 10–15 minutes.)
Ratio: 1:3 (1 part barley to 3 parts cooking liquid)
 Tips: For a deeper flavor, toast barley before soaking and
 cooking. For maximum nutrition, opt for hulled barley (which
 has an extra layer of fiber-rich bran), versus pearl barley (which
 has its outer husk removed). Try barley flakes instead of rolled
 oats in breakfast cereals.

Flavor: sweet to very sweet, with notes of caramel, honey, malt,

(syrup)
Volume: quiet (powder)–moderate/loud (syrup)
What it is: sweetener
 Tips: Barley malt powder can be substituted for sugar. Barley

 molasses. Select organic 100-percent barley malt syrup.

 <br>“Barley malt syrup is a great liquid sweetener I’ll use to
 <br>sweeten desserts like custards, or when making candied nuts.
 <br>Its flavor is distinctive—it’s already caramelized, almost like
 <br>a great Madeira or sherry. I use it in a dessert based on beer
"****** DEMO - www.ebook-converter.com*******"
 <br>and pretzels, where it plays against the maltiness of the

 <br>BARLEY, PEARL (or PEARLED)
Flavor: slightly sweet, with notes of nuts, and a soft, chewy

What it is: grain (not whole)
Nutritional profile: 90% carbs / 7% protein / 3% fat
Calories: 195 per 1-cup serving (cooked)
Protein: 4 grams
Techniques: boil, simmer
Timing: Cook about 30–75 minutes, until tender.
Ratio: 1: 2 ½–3 ½ (1 cup barley to 2 ½–3 ½ cups cooking liquid)
 Tip: Opt for whole-grain barley (which is higher in fiber; see
 BARLEY) when you have the extra time to cook it; otherwise,
 faster-cooking pearl barley (which doesn’t require presoaking)
 will do.

 <br>BEANS—IN GENERAL (or MIXED)
What they are: legumes
Techniques: Always cook thoroughly.
Timing: Most beans require anywhere from a half-hour to two
hours to cook, depending on the type of bean and length of
presoaking.
 Tips: Soak dried beans overnight (or for 8–10 hours) before
 cooking. Drain and rinse the beans before cooking in fresh water
 for about 1–3 hours, depending on the type of bean. While you
 can add alliums (e.g., garlic, onions) or herbs (e.g., parsley,
 thyme) during the cooking process, do not add acid (e.g., lemon,
 tomato, vinegar) during cooking; acids may interfere with the
 cooking process. If you don’t buy salt-free canned beans, rinse
 before using. Dried beans will typically yield three times their
 quantity in cooked beans (i.e., ⅓ cup dried beans = 1 cup cooked
 beans). Certain compatible seasonings also aid in the digestion
 of beans, e.g., asafoetida, cumin, fennel, ginger, kombu, savory.

 <br>“We only cook our beans in clay pots, called olla de barro,
 <br>because they taste so much better cooked that way. When we
 <br>first experimented, we soaked the beans overnight, then
 <br>cooked half in a traditional metal pot and the other half in a
 <br>clay pot [which transmits heat more gently, allowing flavors
